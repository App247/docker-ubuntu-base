docker-ubuntu-base
==================

This repository is used to build an image that contains a minimal expression of an ubuntu operating system with complementary packages for aiding in the installation of an [Odoo](http://www.odoo.com) instance.

Its purpose is to serve as a base image for other _larger_ Odoo images.
